        <p>What you saw above is just a glimpse of what I do. This section will delve deeper into who I am.</p>

        <p>My name is John, and I've been a web developer since 2010. My passion for computers began at an early age; I distinctly remember typing my name on a keyboard before I could even write it. This interest was sparked by my father, who worked with computers, inspiring me to follow in his footsteps.</p>

        <p>Throughout my educational journey, I demonstrated a keen interest in computers, consistently excelling in coding activities. My proficiency in math further strengthened my foundation.</p>

        <p>Choosing Information Technology in college was a natural progression for me. Although I considered Computer Science, I didn't see myself as that nerdy. Additionally, three of my high school classmates were enrolling in the same institute with the same course.</p>

        <p>After four years in college, I embarked on my career as a web developer in 2010, starting at a Thai restaurant's e-commerce site owned by a Chinese woman based in the USA. Over the years, I've worked with various employers, managing diverse projects that showcase my expertise in PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, MySQL, and WordPress.</p>
